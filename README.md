The Xcode project "MovieBrowser" is a demonstration work, made to present my ability to develop iOS apps using SwiftUI and Swift. 

With regard to being a demonstration work, the app presented here is a deluxe version as it consists of about five screens as well as
a couple of sheets. It makes up a movie browser with a user-defined preference filter and three predefined lists (popular, top-rated, and 
upcoming). The browse/list screen supports continuous scrolling in all the database's movies through the three list. Title search can be 
made also in the lists. Furthermore, a detail view of a movie can be shown in a separate detail screen by tapping a movie in the list. In the 
detail screen a movie can be selected to be saved in a user register. The user's movie register is also a screen with a list of movies, that
is the movies selected to be part of the register. Registered items can be removed again from the register.  In the register screen, a movie 
can be tapped on and shown in a separate screen where the user can rate it and make notes on it.

In software terms and generally speaking, the solution demonstrates my abilities to:

- write clean and readable code
- use standard software architectures and patterns such as MVVM, delegation and dependency injection
- construct presentable UI (although simple)
- write unit test using mockups etc.

Furthermore, it demonstrates my knowledge about and ability to work with specific technologies, such as:

- Swift, SwiftUI, CoreData, Combine, HTTP request, JSON data, Git

Other things to mentions:

- The project include some unit tests to demonstrate the testable software architecture used.
- Almost every SwiftUI view in the project has a corresponding preview.
- The project is continously being updated regarding improvement and new iOS and Swift versions.
